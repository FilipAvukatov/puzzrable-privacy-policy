        <h1 class="privacy-title">Privacy Policy</h1>
        <div class="underline-pri-pol"></div>

        <p>
          At <strong>Puzzrable</strong>, I respect your privacy and am committed
          to protecting any personal information you may provide while using the
          app.
        </p>

        <h2><em>Information I Collect</em></h2>
        <p>
        <strong>Puzzrable</strong> itself does not collect or store personally identifiable
        information such as your name, address, or contact details.  
        However, if you choose to contact me through the in-app feedback form, your
        <strong>email address</strong> and optional <strong>name</strong> will be
        sent securely via <strong>Formspree</strong>, a trusted third-party service
        that processes contact submissions.  
        </p>
        <p>
        The app may also store small pieces of data locally on your device
        (for example, to save your progress in puzzles or parables).  
        This data never leaves your device.
        </p>

        <h2>How I Use Your Information</h2>
        <p>
          Any data stored is used solely to improve the user experience and
          ensure the app functions properly.  
          <em>I never share or sell any user data to third parties.</em>
        </p>

        <h2>Third-Party Services</h2>
        <p>
          <strong>Puzzrable</strong> is built using technologies like
          <em>Expo</em> and <em>React Native</em>.  
          These may collect limited technical data (such as crash logs or
          performance metrics) following their own privacy policies.
        </p>

        <h2>Data Security</h2>
        <p>
          Your local data is stored securely on your own device and is not
          transmitted elsewhere.
        </p>

        <h2>Children’s Privacy</h2>
        <p>
          <strong>Puzzrable</strong> is suitable for all audiences.  
          I do not knowingly collect personal information from children under 13
          years old.
        </p>

        <h2>Changes to This Policy</h2>
        <p>
          This Privacy Policy may be updated occasionally to reflect app
          improvements.  
          The “Last Updated” date will always show the most recent version.
        </p>

        <h2>Contact</h2>

          is handled, you can contact me directly at:
